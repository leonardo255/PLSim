## PLSim

#### About
PLSim is a personal simulation project started in early 2024 using the programming language C++. The idea is to develop a deeper understanding of how different kinds of simulation work under the hood (E.g. discrete-event simulations, descrete-time simulations, etc.). The project aims to build a tool based on Nodes, which can be configured and connected together to form complex multipurpose simulation networks.

### Pre-v1.0.0
Currently the project is in the pre-alpha stage and has only been tested on MacOS using LLVM/Clang. So far the development process included:
- Building of UI, including the node graph with interactive nodes
- Creating an entity-component-system for node management 
- First prototype of a discrete-event simulator

For the alpha v1.0.0 I also want to include:
- Integration of the discrete-event simulator with the UI and entity-component-system
- A Save/Load system
- Node presets (e.g. delay node, transport node, etc.)

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
